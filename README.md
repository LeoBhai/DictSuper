📚 DictSuper – Offline Dictionary Progressive Web App (Portfolio Project)
DictSuper is a modern, offline-first dictionary web app with intelligent autocomplete — designed to fetch word definitions from the internet and cache them for offline use. Powered by React, Tailwind CSS, and IndexedDB, this project showcases my ability to build fast, user-friendly web apps with persistent storage and a sleek UI.

It simulates a real-world Google-style dictionary experience and serves as a demonstration of my front-end development, API integration, and PWA capabilities.
