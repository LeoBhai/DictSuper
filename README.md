# 📚 DictSuper – Offline Dictionary Progressive Web App (Portfolio Project)

**DictSuper** is a modern, offline-first dictionary web app with intelligent autocomplete — designed to fetch word definitions from the internet and cache them for offline use. Powered by **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **IndexedDB**, this project showcases my ability to build fast, user-friendly web apps with persistent storage and a sleek UI.

It simulates a real-world Google-style dictionary experience and serves as a demonstration of my front-end development, API integration, and PWA capabilities.
